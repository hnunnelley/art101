                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>This lab focuses on APIs and AJAX and how to use them in your programming. We learned about both of these elements during the assignment.

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>We ran into some issues initially, because the API didn’t work properly in our code. The button appeared on the site, but would not generate anything when pressed. We figured it out by finding a different API online that ended up working with our code. The only issue is, the text shows up with extra symbols.

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>This lab was a learning experience because when we had errors we weren’t sure if it was an issue on the API side or a problem in our code. Because of this we made sure to search for APIs that weren’t outdated, but we also had to be articulate with our code. In the end we were finally able to get something output although it looks a little wonky.

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>We effectively incorporated an API into our site and strengthened our programming skills using AJAX. </p>
